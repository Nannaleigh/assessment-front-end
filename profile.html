    <h3>A Nerd Like Any Other</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is <span>Tatianna</span>. I am a self-described nerd with a wide variety of interests, loves, and passions. I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah and attended Salt Lake Community College. I can be found snickering at any eye-roll worthy pun or with my nose in a book.  </p>
    <h4>A few of my other interests include:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing</li>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Drawing</li>
        <li>Camping</li>
        <li>Board/Card Games</li>
        <li>'The Office'</li>
        <li>Sherlock Holmes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Career Goals and Experience:</h4>
    <p>I have experience in managment and customer service, specializing in de-escalation techniques and problem solving. I also have skills in web-based customer services such as responding professionally to e-mails, chats, and other electronic requests. I have an attention to detail and love the feeling of accomplishment after a job well done. </p>
    <p>Recently, I took the leap out of customer service and pursued a passion I have recently discovered: coding. It perfectly combines structure and problem solving with the added bonus of creativity and out of the box thinking. It is my goal to eventually get paid for playing around with words and scripts all day - doing something I love and never truly working a day in my life.</p>
